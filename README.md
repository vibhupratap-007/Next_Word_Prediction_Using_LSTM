# Next_Word_Prediction_Using_LSTM
This project aims to develop a deep learning model for predicting the next word in a given sequence of words. The model is built using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which are well-suited for sequence prediction tasks. 

# üß† Next Word Prediction Using LSTM

This project implements a deep learning-based **Next Word Prediction** system using **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** networks. It uses text from Shakespeare's *Hamlet* and provides a simple **Streamlit web interface** for users to input text and receive predictions for the next word.
